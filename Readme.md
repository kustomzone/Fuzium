## Fuzium 

A fusion of Electron and Zeronet, with more goodness to come.


### Why?

 * What could be better than combining our favorite opensource technologies. 
 * The name is a play on Chromium which Electron is built on.

 
### What's new?

- (Feb 1, 2017) Integrated [Min Browser](https://github.com/minbrowser/min) with [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
  for extra privacy and instant answers.
  <br>
  It's a ['smarter, faster'](https://minbrowser.github.io/min/) address bar which suits this project perfectly. :surfing_man:
  <br>
- (Feb 11) Integrated bookmarking with [Vue.js](https://github.com/coligo-io/bookmarking-app-electron-vuejs-firebase)
  <br>
- (March 11) New AppCentre homepage allowing users to add their own content to the store. 
  <br> (..user edit and delete option still pending)
- (April 18) Integrated [HackBrower](https://github.com/hackbrowser/hackbrowser) for 'non-Tor' sub-windows.
  <br>

 * Opening a zite in the address bar creates additional toggle switches and sidebar buttons.
 * Need to reload (CTRL-R) occasionally after starting if zeronet boots up late.
 * Still a few display bugs with Zeronet 0.5.3 (toggle On/Off for scrollbar)
